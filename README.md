Since **21.0.2**, you no longer use this repository to download the ADP sample DB data for demo and enterprise deployment.  In `demo` deployment, the sample DB data will be loaded automatically from the IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation Operator.  In `enterprise` deployment, follow the `Loading default sample data` task from the KC [link](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSYHZ8_21.0.x/com.ibm.dba.install/op_topics/tsk_post_dpcak8s_loaddb2.html) to load the required sample DB data.
